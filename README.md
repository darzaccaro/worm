# Worm

A simple snake game in plain C + SDL2.
The graphics were made in Figma. The audio was made by recording an analog synth into Ableton.
This was made as a warmup project for the NYC Handmade Meetup. 
Finishing is its own skill, so I wanted to finish a small project before moving onto something more ambitious.
